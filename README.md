<br>
It is basically a cryptocurrency transaction system. Here a user can see the current value of all currencies. A user can sell his own currency here as well as publish detailed information about his currency in the form of a post. If a user wants to send an invite to a new user by mail, the user who refers will get some currency bonus if a new account is opened through his invite. Those who will work here as employees will regularly update the value of the currency.
